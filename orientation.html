                      <h2>Context</h2>
                         <p>Freshman orientation at Carnegie Mellon in Qatar has always been a big deal. I remember walking into mine in 2015, finding my orientation counsellors dressed in airport staff clothing, and airport decorations everywhere around campus. My confusion ended when we were told that it was tradition for CMUQ to have themes for Orientation each year, as a way to provide a fun, engaging way for new students to learn more about Carnegie Mellon and the community.</p>
                         <p>"How hard could that be?" was a question I struggled to answer two years later, when I was selected as a Head Orientation Counsellor for the incoming freshman batch of 2018.

                    <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 text-left">
                      <h2>The Problem</h2>
                        <p>I know I speak for all four of us Head Orientation Counsellors (HOC for short) when I say that deciding on a theme for orientation had to be the hardest part in organizng the entire 4 day event. As per our instructions, the theme had to be new, unique and something that would be inclusive as well as engaging for the new students. In previous years themes had a consistent "theme" of, dare I say, being generic. "Build Your Future", an orientation centered on the theme of using construction tools and Lego to represent how students will be building the path towards success using the tools that Carnegie Mellon offers them. Another one was "Your Adventure Awaits", an Indiana Jones inspired theme that focused on students' undergraduate "adventure" where they learn along the way.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 text-left">
                      <h2>The Process</h2>
                      <p>After almost three weeks of brainstorming, we came up with a couple ideas, some related to the idea of art and the notion of a "blank canvas". Another was centered around the FIFA World Cup of 2022 that was to be held in Qatar. The latter seemed quite appropriate given that the incoming batch would be the Class of 2022 as well, however we couldn't find a way to make this theme inclusive for those that were not particularly interested in sports, especially soccer. It wasn't until the fourth week when there arose a question: Why not a Carnegie Mellon theme?</p>
                      <p>Everyone at the meeting started scratching their heads. How had no one thought of this? Whats a better way to introduce the incoming students to Carnegie Mellon than through a theme centered around Carnegie Mellon, and the pride of being a Tartan (a colloquial term used to refer to a Carnegie Mellon student).</p>
                      <p>Everyone in the organizing team told us that it was a splendid idea, and so we chose our theme: <em class="bodyemph">Make Your Mark!</em> The Orientation for the incoming class of 2022 that was to be based around the theme of Carnegie Mellon itself. The identity of this specific event would follow branding guidelines that Carnegie Mellon used for its own marketing and corporate affiars. This also made our Orientation more <em class="bodyemph">economically sustainable</em>, as any decorations we would purchase using the Orientation budget could be made permanent decorations on campus, due to the relevancy.</p>

                        <h2>The Product</h2>
                        <h3>Logo</h3>
                           <p>The most important task was to design a logo in order to represent the Make Your Mark theme. As with any other logo design project, we had to be creative in the way we wanted to incorporate type as well as aspects of Carnegie Mellon into the logo. My first design was a Tartan plaid dog paw. This was fairly simple to make, and incorporated two of Carnegie Mellon's very important branding assets: The Tartan Plaid and the Scotty mascot. Through this, we were able to create a very simple, scalable logo that offered a great amount of versatility in its use. </p>

                           <hr>
                           <p>As cute as the design was, we faced issues when we contacted vendors to use the logo for branded merchandise, the complaint being that the logo had too many colors. Stripping the log of its colors would make it an ordinary paw, and we had to come up with a new logo now.</p>
                           <p>During our brainstorming for the theme earlier, at one point we had come up with an idea for a theme that incorporated elements of mail, post offices and stamps. During a work session, we randomly decided to mess around with that idea, and try to include some aspect into our theme and logo design. One moodboard led to another, and we successfully ended up with a logo that vendors wouldn't have a problem working with, and one that incorporated a crucial part of Carnegie Mellon: its signature building architecture. Thus, our final logo came into being.</p>

                        <h3>Orientation Guide</h3>
                        <p>My second important design project for Orientation, was to design an Orientation Guide for the freshmen. This would be a handbook for the freshmen, containing a wealth of information and campus resources. Of course, I had to make sure that this was relevant to the theme as well. My main challenge was to come up with a graphic that incorporated Carnegie Mellon elements and at the same time was unique. I chose to go with the official Carnegie Mellon colors, and design a polygonal graphic using the colors. I then used this graphic in the booklet itself, as well is in other marketing materials used during the event.</p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>This project in particular was my very first project that involved branding and identity design, quite especially in terms of their value. All our hard work and thought that we had put into this event and every single aspect of it, was reflected by the amount of confused smirks that turned into cheerful smiles by the end of the event. This was also quite the learning experience for me, in realizing the importance of paying attention to even the smallest amount of detail, in order to create a consistent, engaging experience for the "user".
