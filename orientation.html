                      <h2>Context</h2>
                         <p>Freshman orientation at Carnegie Mellon in Qatar has always been a big deal. I remember walking into mine in 2015, finding my orientation counsellors dressed in airport staff clothing, and airport decorations everywhere around campus. My confusion ended when we were told that it was tradition for CMUQ to have themes for Orientation each year, as a way to provide a fun, engaging way for new students to learn more about Carnegie Mellon and the community.</p>
                         <p>"How hard could that be?" was a question I struggled to answer two years later, when I was selected as a Head Orientation Counsellor for the incoming freshman batch of 2018.

                    <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 text-left">
                      <h2>The Problem</h2>
                        <p>I know I speak for all four of us Head Orientation Counsellors (HOC for short) when I say that deciding on a theme for orientation had to be the hardest part in organizng the entire 4 day event. As per our instructions, the theme had to be new, unique and something that would be inclusive as well as engaging for the new students.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 text-left">
                      <h2>The Process</h2>
                      <p>And so the brainstorming began. In previous years themes had a consistent "theme" of, dare I say, being generic. "Build Your Future", an orientation centered on the theme of using construction tools and Lego to represent how students will be building the path towards success using the tools that Carnegie Mellon offers them. Another one was "Your Adventure Awaits", an Indiana Jones inspired theme that focused on students' undergraduate "adventure" where they learn along the way.</p>
                      <p>After almost three weeks of regular meetings, we came up with a couple ideas, some related to the idea of art and the notion of a "blank canvas". Another was centered around the FIFA World Cup of 2022 that was to be held in Qatar. The latter seemed quite appropriate given that the incoming batch would be the Class of 2022 as well, however we couldn't find a way to make this theme inclusive for those that were not particularly interested in sports, especially soccer. It wasn't until the fourth week when there arose a question: Why not a Carnegie Mellon theme?</p>
                      <p>Everyone at the meeting started scratching their heads. How had no one thought of this? Whats a better way to introduce the incoming students to Carnegie Mellon than through a theme centered around Carnegie Mellon, and the pride of being a Tartan (a colloquial term used to refer to a Carnegie Mellon student).</p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                           <p>As my first ever product design project, I was very pleased with the outcome. I got to get my hands dirty with new tools such as Adobe XD (my current favorite UI Design software), and harness my creative problem solving to attempt to solve a problem that many individuals face on a daily basis. I was particularly pleased with the UX and UI of the prototype, for which we ended up as runner-ups for a <em class="bodyemph">Deloitte Innovation Award for Best User Experience</em>. My three main takeaways for this project were:</p>
                           <ol>
                             <li>DO NOT underestimate the power of research and data.</li>
                             <li>DO NOT be afraid to pivot and make necessary changes, even if it could mean flipping the entire idea on its head.</li>
                             <li>DO take part in various other roles in the design process. Product strategy is just as important as the product design.</li>
                           </ol><br>
